## Instructions
Rename the Home_Sales_starter_code.ipynb file as Home_Sales.ipynb.

Import the necessary PySpark SQL functions for this assignment.

Read the home_sales_revised.csv data in the starter code into a Spark DataFrame.

Create a temporary table called home_sales.

Answer the following questions using SparkSQL:

## What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

## What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

![3-bedroom-houses](/images/avg_3bdrm.png)

## What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

## What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.

## Cache your temporary table home_sales.

## Check if your temporary table is cached.

## Using the cached data, run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime.

## Partition by the "date_built" field on the formatted parquet home sales data.

## Create a temporary table for the parquet data.

## Run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime.

## Uncache the home_sales temporary table.

## Verify that the home_sales temporary table is uncached using PySpark.
